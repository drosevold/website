      Chris Minnick and Eva Holland are the co-founders of [WatzThis?](https://twitter.com/WatzThisCo) and the co-authors of [Coding with JavaScript For Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/Coding-JavaScript-Dummies-Chris-Minnick/dp/1119056071/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431562002&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+minnick), which has an official world-wide release date of June 1, 2015. The book, and it's accompanying Codecademy course, teaches beginners how to program web applications using JavaScript. This is the first new JavaScript book in the For Dummies series since 2004 -- so, needless to say, this book has been a long time coming and it brings the state of JavaScript For Dummies up to modern standards.
