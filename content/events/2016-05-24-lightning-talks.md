    title: Lightning Talks!
    description: >
      Let's have some fun heading in to the summer!


      A lightning talk is a short presentation lasting only a few minutes. Being of such short length, it is a great way for new speakers to try their hand at presenting to our group. For more experienced speakers, it is a way to work on making a more concise presentation.


      We are accepting talk topics on _anything_! If you can talk about it for five minutes, that likely means that you are passionate about it. We want to hear about your passions! You can talk about Javascript, web technology, Java 6, bicycle repair, or flower arranging!

      The F word can cripple us to the point where we canâ€™t move forward and hold us back from our true potential. After this talk, you will be able to get out of it's vicious clutches.

    title: The Joy of Clothoid Curves
    description: >
      Clothoids are an exciting alternative to traditional Bezier curves. Clothoids are great for logos, cartoon characters, 2D animation, and even steering self-driving cars. This talk will demonstrate the sheer awesomeness of clothoids with a small app of mine, followed by a brief introduction to the math if time allows.

    title: From Monet to JavaScript in 5 minutes
    description: >
      Impressionist painters like Claude Monet were masters of color interaction. Artists able to create that kind of magic are rare today. Yet it is possible to understand why those paintings appear so luminous, and learn how to make color work in art and design. New technology can assist with learning color relationships.

    title: But I just Learned Gulp ðŸ˜•
    description: >
      This talk would be about my views on the fast pace Web Dev world. New things are showing up each day, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. Hopefully, this will help put some minds at ease, because it's OK if your side project isn't built with React.

    title: Node "vs" Nashorn on the Server
    description: >
      Discussion of performance characteristics of JS code running on Node.js and Nashorn (Java 8's "jjs" scripting tool).

      Which is faster depends on the duration / repetitiveness of the run.

    title: How to Market your project
    description: >
      So, youâ€™ve developed your project. Now what? You mom and your pet canâ€™t be your only users. Youâ€™ve defined who your target user is. Right?


      It canâ€™t be everyone, everywhere.


      Will your product look the same for a Kenyan national who is training for the Olympics this summer? Will your project better suit the needs of an accountant who works remotely with small businesses who have less than 10 employees? Or will your project most benefit urban farmers in LA or Detroit?


      Marketing is based on stories and emotions. Connecting your potential customer to why they need your product over a competitorâ€™s. What is the problem your project solving?
