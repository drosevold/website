    title: Promises? Promises!
    description: >
      Promises can drastically improve the way we are writing our async code. They give us back the ability to centralize our error handling and return values from functions like we can in synchronous code.


      We'll be going over what Promises are, what they can do, and how we can start using them.


      If we have time, we will then take a look at the future async / await features that are making their way into the spec.
