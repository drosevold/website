    title: Easy front-end JavaScript testing with Cypress
    description: >
      Cypress is a new(ish?) test framework that makes testing front-end code easy and fast right out of the box. I'll demonstrate how we're using it with a non-trivial real-world example, and I'll also go over some of the great recommendations from the Cypress documentation that have helped us keep our front-end tests manageable.
