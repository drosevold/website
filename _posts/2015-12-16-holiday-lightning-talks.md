    title: Lightning Talks!
    description: >
      Let's have some fun heading in to the holiday season!


      A lightning talk is a short presentation lasting only a few minutes. Being of such short length, it is a great way for new speakers to try their hand at presenting to our group. For more experienced speakers, it is a way to work on making a more concise presentation.


      We are accepting talk topics on _anything_! If you can talk about it for five minutes, that likely means that you are passionate about it. We want to hear about your passions! You can talk about Javascript, web technology, Java 6, bicycle repair, or flower arranging!

      The Rust programming language is built in a way that the code will not compile unless it safe. So with that worry out of the way now high level programmers, like javascript developers, can dip their feet into the systems programming world and see how the water feels.
