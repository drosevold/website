    title: A middle-aged man hacks Super Mario Bros. You won't believe what happens next.
    description: >
      I talked with Derek a million years ago about programming the NES and he said that that could be a fun talk. I still would like to try that someday, but in the interim I propose something a little more fun--hacking SMB1 for the NES!


      I will cover three different types of hacks:


      * Game Genie tomfoolery (dynamic ROM editing).

      * Text replacement and translation shenanigans (altering ROM).

      * World Randomizer (altering ROM).


      However, it's not all fun and games; expect to learn about the following topics:


      * NES memory model.

      * NES pattern tables.

      * Some 6502 assembly programming.

    title: Brief History of JavaScript Module
    description: >
      Are you new to JavaScript and confused about modules, module loaders and module bundlers? Or you have been writing JavaScript code for a while, but canâ€™t get a grip of the jargons about module? You heard about the jargons like CommonJS, AMD, Browserify, SystemJS, Webpack, JSPM, etc., but donâ€™t understand why we need them?


      I will try to explain what are they, and what problem they try to solve, and how they solve the problem.
