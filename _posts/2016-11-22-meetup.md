    title: A middle-aged man hacks Super Mario Bros. You won't believe what happens next.

      I talked with Derek a million years ago about programming the NES and he said that that could be a fun talk. I still would like to try that someday, but in the interim I propose something a little more fun--hacking SMB1 for the NES!


      I will cover three different types of hacks:


      * Game Genie tomfoolery (dynamic ROM editing).

      * Text replacement and translation shenanigans (altering ROM).

      * World Randomizer (altering ROM).


      However, it's not all fun and games; expect to learn about the following topics:


      * NES memory model.

      * NES pattern tables.

      * Some 6502 assembly programming.
