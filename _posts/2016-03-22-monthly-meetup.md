    title: You Too Can Be A Sketching Machine
    description: >
      Sketching is a critical skill that spans all job titles. Whether working individually or in a group, our ability to sketch helps make our abstract ideas real. By sketching we can ideate, iterate and communicate our ideas more effectively. With the addition of a few simple approaches, you can incorporate sketching into your daily activities to harness the power of sketching so you too can be a sketching machine.
