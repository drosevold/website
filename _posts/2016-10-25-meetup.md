    title: You Should Write Tests
    description: >
      *  Why should we test our code?

      *  Should we always write tests for our code?

      *  What benefits do we gain from tests?

      *  How can we write good tests?

      *  Is TDD worth it?


      We'll go over the benefits of testing, as well as how to get started writing a test suite for our JavaScript code, and some cool tools we can use to make our lives easier.
