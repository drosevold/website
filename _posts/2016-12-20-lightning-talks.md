Let's have some fun heading in to the holiday season!

A lightning talk is a short presentation lasting only a few minutes. Being of such short length, it is a great way for new speakers to try their hand at presenting to our group. For more experienced speakers, it is a way to work on making a more concise presentation.

We are accepting talk topics on _anything_! If you can talk about it for five minutes, that likely means that you are passionate about it. We want to hear about your passions! You can talk about Javascript, web technology, Java 6, bicycle repair, or flower arranging!
