NodeSchool is an event that helps people new to JavaScript, Node.js, or programming in general get comfortable with self directed lessons. It is a group learning experience, where people of all skill levels come together to strengthen their understanding of JavaScript.

For more information, check out the main [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) website.

> NOTE: It is highly encouraged that you [have Node pre-installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) prior to coming to the event. This helps you hit the ground running and frees up our mentors to focus on helping through workshop issues and not installation issues.
